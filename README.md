<h1> Scraper_SectorWatch </h1>

<h3> What it achieves </h3>

Created specifically for MarketWatch website to streamline operations. It grabs the title, link and other video details on the webpage and stores it in a csv to avoid the use of third-party software to keep a tab of published data. 

<h3> Methodology for using the scraper </h3>

Open Terminal (Go to your Mac’s search bar and type terminal)
Type below 3 commands in Terminal
(In the white rectangular box copy below 3 lines one by one and press enter after each)

Go to the project folder
source venv/bin/activate
jupyter notebook 


The above should open up a webpage.

You will find your csv file in the folder
